# Water-Surface-Extent
A mini project titled "Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Water Surface Extent using Water Indices" #AWEI #MNDWI #LANDSAT8

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a robust and time-efficient approach to mapping water surface extent by combining satellite-derived spectral indices with thresholding techniques. A spatio-temporal analysis was performed on reservoir imagery using cloud-free Landsat 8 data from 2018 to 2022. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) were used alongside binary and Otsu thresholding to accurately delineate water bodies.
